This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.

AWS Batch is a batch processing tool for efficiently running hundreds of thousands computing jobs in AWS. Batch can dynamically provision different types of compute resources based on the resource requirements of submitted jobs.

AWS Batch simplifies the planning, scheduling, and executions of your batch workloads across a full range of compute services like [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and [Spot Resources](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/).

Batch achieves this by utilizing queue processing of batch job requests. To successfully submit a job for execution, you need the following resources:

1. [Job Definition](#job-definition) - *Group various job properties (container image, resource requirements, env variables...) into a single definition. These definitions are used at job submission time.*
2. [Compute Environment](#compute-environment) - *the execution runtime of submitted batch jobs*
3. [Job Queue](#job-queue) - *the queue where batch jobs can be submitted to via AWS SDK/CLI*

For more information on **AWS Batch** visit the [AWS Docs for Batch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/index.html).

## Compute Environment

At the core of AWS Batch is the compute environment. All batch jobs are processed within a compute environment, which uses resource like OnDemand/Spot EC2 instances or Fargate.

In **MANAGED** mode, AWS will handle the provisioning of compute resources to accommodate the demand. Otherwise, in **UNMANAGED** mode, you will need to manage the provisioning of those resources.

Below is an example of each available type of compute environment:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


# default is managed
aws_managed_environment = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "AWS-Managed-Compute-Env",
    compute_resources=batch.ComputeResources(
        vpc=vpc
    )
)

customer_managed_environment = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "Customer-Managed-Compute-Env",
    managed=False
)
```

### Spot-Based Compute Environment

It is possible to have AWS Batch submit spotfleet requests for obtaining compute resources. Below is an example of how this can be done:

```python
vpc = ec2.Vpc(self, "VPC")

spot_environment = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "MySpotEnvironment",
    compute_resources=batch.ComputeResources(
        type=batch.ComputeResourceType.SPOT,
        bid_percentage=75,  # Bids for resources at 75% of the on-demand price
        vpc=vpc
    )
)
```

### Fargate Compute Environment

It is possible to have AWS Batch submit jobs to be run on Fargate compute resources. Below is an example of how this can be done:

```python
vpc = ec2.Vpc(self, "VPC")

fargate_spot_environment = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "MyFargateEnvironment",
    compute_resources=batch.ComputeResources(
        type=batch.ComputeResourceType.FARGATE_SPOT,
        vpc=vpc
    )
)
```

### Understanding Progressive Allocation Strategies

AWS Batch uses an [allocation strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/allocation-strategies.html) to determine what compute resource will efficiently handle incoming job requests. By default, **BEST_FIT** will pick an available compute instance based on vCPU requirements. If none exist, the job will wait until resources become available. However, with this strategy, you may have jobs waiting in the queue unnecessarily despite having more powerful instances available. Below is an example of how that situation might look like:

```plaintext
Compute Environment:

1. m5.xlarge => 4 vCPU
2. m5.2xlarge => 8 vCPU
```

```plaintext
Job Queue:
---------
| A | B |
---------

Job Requirements:
A => 4 vCPU - ALLOCATED TO m5.xlarge
B => 2 vCPU - WAITING
```

In this situation, Batch will allocate **Job A** to compute resource #1 because it is the most cost efficient resource that matches the vCPU requirement. However, with this `BEST_FIT` strategy, **Job B** will not be allocated to our other available compute resource even though it is strong enough to handle it. Instead, it will wait until the first job is finished processing or wait a similar `m5.xlarge` resource to be provisioned.

The alternative would be to use the `BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE` strategy in order for the remaining job to be handled in larger containers regardless of vCPU requirement and costs.

### Launch template support

Simply define your Launch Template:

```python
my_launch_template = ec2.CfnLaunchTemplate(self, "LaunchTemplate",
    launch_template_name="extra-storage-template",
    launch_template_data=ec2.CfnLaunchTemplate.LaunchTemplateDataProperty(
        block_device_mappings=[ec2.CfnLaunchTemplate.BlockDeviceMappingProperty(
            device_name="/dev/xvdcz",
            ebs=ec2.CfnLaunchTemplate.EbsProperty(
                encrypted=True,
                volume_size=100,
                volume_type="gp2"
            )
        )
        ]
    )
)
```

And provide `launchTemplateName`:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# my_launch_template: ec2.CfnLaunchTemplate


my_compute_env = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "ComputeEnv",
    compute_resources=batch.ComputeResources(
        launch_template=batch.LaunchTemplateSpecification(
            launch_template_name=my_launch_template.launch_template_name
        ),
        vpc=vpc
    ),
    compute_environment_name="MyStorageCapableComputeEnvironment"
)
```

Or provide `launchTemplateId` instead:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# my_launch_template: ec2.CfnLaunchTemplate


my_compute_env = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "ComputeEnv",
    compute_resources=batch.ComputeResources(
        launch_template=batch.LaunchTemplateSpecification(
            launch_template_id=my_launch_template.ref
        ),
        vpc=vpc
    ),
    compute_environment_name="MyStorageCapableComputeEnvironment"
)
```

### Importing an existing Compute Environment

To import an existing batch compute environment, call `ComputeEnvironment.fromComputeEnvironmentArn()`.

Below is an example:

```python
compute_env = batch.ComputeEnvironment.from_compute_environment_arn(self, "imported-compute-env", "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:555555555555:compute-environment/My-Compute-Env")
```

### Change the baseline AMI of the compute resources

Occasionally, you will need to deviate from the default processing AMI.

ECS Optimized Amazon Linux 2 example:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

my_compute_env = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "ComputeEnv",
    compute_resources=batch.ComputeResources(
        image=ecs.EcsOptimizedAmi(
            generation=ec2.AmazonLinuxGeneration.AMAZON_LINUX_2
        ),
        vpc=vpc
    )
)
```

Custom based AMI example:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

my_compute_env = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "ComputeEnv",
    compute_resources=batch.ComputeResources(
        image=ec2.MachineImage.generic_linux({
            "[aws-region]": "[ami-ID]"
        }),
        vpc=vpc
    )
)
```

## Job Queue

Jobs are always submitted to a specific queue. This means that you have to create a queue before you can start submitting jobs. Each queue is mapped to at least one (and no more than three) compute environment. When the job is scheduled for execution, AWS Batch will select the compute environment based on ordinal priority and available capacity in each environment.

```python
# compute_environment: batch.ComputeEnvironment

job_queue = batch.JobQueue(self, "JobQueue",
    compute_environments=[batch.JobQueueComputeEnvironment(
        # Defines a collection of compute resources to handle assigned batch jobs
        compute_environment=compute_environment,
        # Order determines the allocation order for jobs (i.e. Lower means higher preference for job assignment)
        order=1
    )
    ]
)
```

### Priorty-Based Queue Example

Sometimes you might have jobs that are more important than others, and when submitted, should take precedence over the existing jobs. To achieve this, you can create a priority based execution strategy, by assigning each queue its own priority:

```python
# shared_compute_envs: batch.ComputeEnvironment

high_prio_queue = batch.JobQueue(self, "JobQueue",
    compute_environments=[batch.JobQueueComputeEnvironment(
        compute_environment=shared_compute_envs,
        order=1
    )],
    priority=2
)

low_prio_queue = batch.JobQueue(self, "JobQueue",
    compute_environments=[batch.JobQueueComputeEnvironment(
        compute_environment=shared_compute_envs,
        order=1
    )],
    priority=1
)
```

By making sure to use the same compute environments between both job queues, we will give precedence to the `highPrioQueue` for the assigning of jobs to available compute environments.

### Importing an existing Job Queue

To import an existing batch job queue, call `JobQueue.fromJobQueueArn()`.

Below is an example:

```python
job_queue = batch.JobQueue.from_job_queue_arn(self, "imported-job-queue", "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:555555555555:job-queue/High-Prio-Queue")
```

## Job Definition

A Batch Job definition helps AWS Batch understand important details about how to run your application in the scope of a Batch Job. This involves key information like resource requirements, what containers to run, how the compute environment should be prepared, and more. Below is a simple example of how to create a job definition:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_ecr as ecr


repo = ecr.Repository.from_repository_name(self, "batch-job-repo", "todo-list")

batch.JobDefinition(self, "batch-job-def-from-ecr",
    container=batch.JobDefinitionContainer(
        image=ecs.EcrImage(repo, "latest")
    )
)
```

### Using a local Docker project

Below is an example of how you can create a Batch Job Definition from a local Docker application.

```python
batch.JobDefinition(self, "batch-job-def-from-local",
    container=batch.JobDefinitionContainer(
        # todo-list is a directory containing a Dockerfile to build the application
        image=ecs.ContainerImage.from_asset("../todo-list")
    )
)
```

### Providing custom log configuration

You can provide custom log driver and its configuration for the container.

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_ssm as ssm


batch.JobDefinition(self, "job-def",
    container=batch.JobDefinitionContainer(
        image=ecs.EcrImage.from_registry("docker/whalesay"),
        log_configuration=batch.LogConfiguration(
            log_driver=batch.LogDriver.AWSLOGS,
            options={"awslogs-region": "us-east-1"},
            secret_options=[
                batch.ExposedSecret.from_parameters_store("xyz", ssm.StringParameter.from_string_parameter_name(self, "parameter", "xyz"))
            ]
        )
    )
)
```

### Using the secret on secrets manager

You can set the environment variables from secrets manager.

```python
db_secret = secretsmanager.Secret(self, "secret")

batch.JobDefinition(self, "batch-job-def-secrets",
    container=batch.JobDefinitionContainer(
        image=ecs.EcrImage.from_registry("docker/whalesay"),
        secrets={
            "PASSWORD": ecs.Secret.from_secrets_manager(db_secret, "password")
        }
    )
)
```

### Importing an existing Job Definition

#### From ARN

To import an existing batch job definition from its ARN, call `JobDefinition.fromJobDefinitionArn()`.

Below is an example:

```python
job = batch.JobDefinition.from_job_definition_arn(self, "imported-job-definition", "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:555555555555:job-definition/my-job-definition")
```

#### From Name

To import an existing batch job definition from its name, call `JobDefinition.fromJobDefinitionName()`.
If name is specified without a revision then the latest active revision is used.

Below is an example:

```python
# Without revision
job1 = batch.JobDefinition.from_job_definition_name(self, "imported-job-definition", "my-job-definition")

# With revision
job2 = batch.JobDefinition.from_job_definition_name(self, "imported-job-definition", "my-job-definition:3")
```

        :param vpc: (experimental) The VPC network that all compute resources will be connected to.
        :param allocation_strategy: (experimental) The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource in case not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated. This could be due to availability of the instance type in the region or Amazon EC2 service limits. If this is not specified, the default for the EC2 ComputeResourceType is BEST_FIT, which will use only the best fitting instance type, waiting for additional capacity if it's not available. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with BEST_FIT then the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified. BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE will select an additional instance type that is large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for an instance type with a lower cost. The default value for the SPOT instance type is SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED, which is only available for for this type of compute resources and will select an additional instance type that is large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for an instance type that is less likely to be interrupted. Default: AllocationStrategy.BEST_FIT
        :param bid_percentage: (experimental) This property will be ignored if you set the environment type to ON_DEMAND. The maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be when compared with the On-Demand price for that instance type before instances are launched. For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, then the Spot price must be below 20% of the current On-Demand price for that EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. If you leave this field empty, the default value is 100% of the On-Demand price. Default: 100
        :param compute_resources_tags: (experimental) Key-value pair tags to be applied to resources that are launched in the compute environment. For AWS Batch, these take the form of "String1": "String2", where String1 is the tag key and String2 is the tag value—for example, { "Name": "AWS Batch Instance - C4OnDemand" }. Default: - no tags will be assigned on compute resources.
        :param desiredv_cpus: (experimental) The desired number of EC2 vCPUS in the compute environment. Default: - no desired vcpu value will be used.
        :param ec2_key_pair: (experimental) The EC2 key pair that is used for instances launched in the compute environment. If no key is defined, then SSH access is not allowed to provisioned compute resources. Default: - no SSH access will be possible.
        :param image: (experimental) The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID used for instances launched in the compute environment. Default: - no image will be used.
        :param instance_role: (experimental) The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a compute environment. You can specify the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance profile. For example, ecsInstanceRole or arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:instance-profile/ecsInstanceRole . For more information, see Amazon ECS Instance Role in the AWS Batch User Guide. Default: - a new role will be created.
        :param instance_types: (experimental) The types of EC2 instances that may be launched in the compute environment. You can specify instance families to launch any instance type within those families (for example, c4 or p3), or you can specify specific sizes within a family (such as c4.8xlarge). You can also choose optimal to pick instance types (from the C, M, and R instance families) on the fly that match the demand of your job queues. Default: optimal
        :param launch_template: (experimental) An optional launch template to associate with your compute resources. For more information, see README file. Default: - no custom launch template will be used
        :param maxv_cpus: (experimental) The maximum number of EC2 vCPUs that an environment can reach. Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. You must specify at least one vCPU. Default: 256
        :param minv_cpus: (experimental) The minimum number of EC2 vCPUs that an environment should maintain (even if the compute environment state is DISABLED). Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. By keeping this set to 0 you will not have instance time wasted when there is no work to be run. If you set this above zero you will maintain that number of vCPUs at all times. Default: 0
        :param placement_group: (experimental) The Amazon EC2 placement group to associate with your compute resources. Default: - No placement group will be used.
        :param security_groups: (experimental) The EC2 security group(s) associated with instances launched in the compute environment. Default: - AWS default security group.
        :param spot_fleet_role: (experimental) This property will be ignored if you set the environment type to ON_DEMAND. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet IAM role applied to a SPOT compute environment. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet Role in the AWS Batch User Guide. Default: - no fleet role will be used.
        :param type: (experimental) The type of compute environment: ON_DEMAND, SPOT, FARGATE, or FARGATE_SPOT. Default: ON_DEMAND
        :param vpc_subnets: (experimental) The VPC subnets into which the compute resources are launched. Default: - private subnets of the supplied VPC.
